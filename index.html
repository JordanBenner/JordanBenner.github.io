    <div id="About-me">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>In my life and backround I am dynamic and able to wear many hats. I love to dabble in new things and I have been an entrepreneur from a young age.
          <br> I started working full time when I was 16 and Homeschooled myself throughout High School to do so. From then on I have had a pretty different work ethic than anyone else
          <br> I have come to know. I come from a big family where working hard is just a part of life and sacrifice is the bread and butter.
          <br>The biggest issue I have with most jobs and including some of the ones I have had is that they cannot capacitate someone like me for more than two years because either
          <br> I outgrow them or I get their business to a place where it runs smoothly and is perfectly managed and it's time for me to move on to my next opportunity.
          <br>In my current job I have found the freedom and independance to further myself farther thatn I ever would have dreamed and in the coming months I plan on extending my network
          <br> and hopefully meeting you in person as well as developing a business relationship through LinkedIn. Feel free to write me with any questions regarding any kind of home
          <br>building, renovations, additions, remodels and I will be happy assist.
